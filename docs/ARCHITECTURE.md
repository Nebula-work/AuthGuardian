## System Overview

The RBAC System is designed as a simplified alternative to complex identity and access management systems like Keycloak. It provides core functionality for user authentication, role-based authorization, and multi-tenant organization management.

The system consists of:

1. A Go backend API service with a RESTful interface
2. A React frontend web application
3. A MongoDB database for data persistence

## Architecture Principles

The system follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The codebase is organized into distinct layers with well-defined responsibilities.
2. **RESTful API Design**: The API follows REST principles with clear resource naming and appropriate HTTP methods.
3. **Stateless Authentication**: JWT-based authentication enables stateless server operation.
4. **Multi-tenancy**: The system supports multiple organizations with isolated resources and permissions.
5. **Modular Design**: Components are designed to be loosely coupled for easier maintenance and extension.

## Component Architecture

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture:

1. **Routing Layer**: Defines API endpoints and routes requests to appropriate handlers
2. **Handler Layer**: Processes HTTP requests and responses
3. **Service Layer**: Implements business logic and domain rules
4. **Data Access Layer**: Manages database operations and data persistence

Key components:

- **Router**: Maps API endpoints to handler functions using the Fiber framework
- **Middleware**: Provides cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling
- **Handlers**: Process HTTP requests, validate inputs, and format responses
- **Services**: Implement business logic and orchestrate operations
- **Models**: Define data structures and domain objects
- **Database Client**: Manages connections and interactions with MongoDB

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture:

1. **Page Components**: Represent full application pages/screens
2. **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements used across multiple pages
3. **Context Providers**: Manage global state (e.g., authentication)
4. **Service Modules**: Handle API communication and data transformation
5. **Utility Modules**: Provide helper functions and shared logic

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (username/password) or initiates OAuth flow
2. Backend validates credentials or processes OAuth callback
3. On successful authentication, backend generates a JWT token
4. Token is returned to the client and stored in browser storage
5. Client includes token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. Backend validates token and extracts user information for authorization

### Authorization Flow

1. Client makes a request with JWT token in the Authorization header
2. Authentication middleware validates the token and extracts user ID, roles, and organizations
3. Authorization middleware checks if the user has required permissions for the requested resource/action
4. If authorized, the request proceeds to the handler; otherwise, a 403 Forbidden response is returned

### Data Modification Flow

1. Client sends a data modification request (POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. Request passes through authentication and authorization middleware
3. Handler validates request data and parameters
4. Service layer applies business rules and validation
5. Data access layer performs database operations
6. Response with success or error information is returned to the client

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Security

1. **Password Security**:
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
   - Password complexity requirements are enforced
   - Failed login attempts are rate-limited

2. **JWT Security**:
   - Tokens have a configurable expiration time
   - Token payload includes user ID, roles, and organization information
   - Tokens are signed with a secret key to prevent tampering

3. **OAuth Security**:
   - OAuth integrations follow OAuth 2.0 best practices
   - State parameters are validated to prevent CSRF attacks
   - OAuth tokens are not stored; they are exchanged for application-specific JWTs

### Authorization Security

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Users are assigned roles, which contain sets of permissions
   - Permissions define allowed operations on specific resources
   - Authorization decisions are based on the user's roles and the requested resource/action

2. **Multi-tenancy Security**:
   - Resources are scoped to organizations
   - Users can belong to multiple organizations
   - Permissions can be organization-specific or system-wide

### API Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - All API inputs are validated before processing
   - Validation rules are defined for each data type and field

2. **Output Sanitization**:
   - Sensitive data is filtered from API responses
   - Error messages don't expose internal system details

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to restrict unauthorized domains
   - Preflight requests are handled correctly

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed with scalability in mind:

1. **Stateless Architecture**: The backend is stateless, allowing horizontal scaling with multiple instances
2. **Database Scalability**: MongoDB supports sharding for distributing data across multiple servers
3. **Caching Opportunities**: The system can be extended with caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Pagination**: API endpoints support pagination to handle large data sets efficiently

## Integration Points

The system provides several integration points:

1. **REST API**: The primary integration method for external systems
2. **OAuth Providers**: Integration with Google and GitHub for authentication
3. **JWT Token Verification**: External systems can verify and use the issued JWTs
4. **Database Access**: Direct database access for advanced reporting or data migration needs (with appropriate access controls)

### API Integration

External systems can integrate with the RBAC System using the REST API with JWT authentication:

1. Obtain a token via the authentication endpoints
2. Include the token in the Authorization header for API requests
3. Process API responses according to the documented formats

### OAuth Integration

The system can be extended to support additional OAuth providers:

1. Register an application with the OAuth provider
2. Configure the provider's credentials in the system
3. Add the provider to the authentication handlers
4. Implement any provider-specific logic for user profile mapping
